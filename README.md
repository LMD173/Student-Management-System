# Student Management System

A console-based C# application which simulates a student management system.

## Usage

1. Download all the files
2. In the directory with the files, run `dotnet run` (make sure to have .NET installed; this program was made with .NET 8)
3. The Program looks for a `SMS_DB_PATH` environment variable to find the database file. However, to keep things simple, it uses a default value of `./sms-data.db` which is in the root directory of the program's files (so no need to change anything for this step).
